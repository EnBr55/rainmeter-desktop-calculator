# Rainmeter Desktop Calculator

A scientific text-input-based calculator for your desktop, as a rainmeter skin.

## Forewarning
I created this project to experiment a bit with making a rainmeter skin. While I no longer use rainmeter for various reasons, I did find this skin to be particularly useful and fun for quick little calculations.

I don't plan on updating this project in the foreseeable future, as I'm no longer interested in rainmeter; but feel free to use/fork.
