# Rainmeter Desktop Calculator

A scientific text-input-based calculator for your desktop, as a rainmeter skin.

## Forewarning

I created this project to experiment a bit with making a rainmeter skin. While I no longer use rainmeter for various reasons, I did find this skin to be particularly useful and fun for quick little calculations.

I don't plan on updating this project in the foreseeable future, as I'm no longer interested in rainmeter; but feel free to use/fork.

## Installation

To install, drop the DesktopCalc folder into your directory for rainmeter skins.

## Usage

The main calculator will query [the math.js api](https://api.mathjs.org/). For syntax, please see [their documentation](https://mathjs.org/docs/index.html).

The offline mode simply uses LUA as a calculator, so as you can expect, there will be limited functionality.

#### ans

The plaintext `ans` will be substituted with the output of the previous expression entered.
